## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r loading}
getwd()
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)

MRIP.90s <- read.csv("./Final Project/mrip_estim_catch_1990_2019/mrip_estim_catch_wave_1990_2019.csv",
                      header = TRUE)

MRIP.00s <- read.csv("./Final Project/mrip_estim_catch_2010_2020/mrip_estim_catch_wave_2010_2020.csv",
                     header = TRUE)

```

```{r tidying}

MRIP.00s.tidy <- MRIP.00s %>%
  select(YEAR, WAVE, MODE_FX, AREA_X, TOT_CAT) %>%
  mutate(Date = my(paste0(WAVE,"-",YEAR)))
#need to figure out how to make waves correspond to their actual months - 1 = 1/2, 2 = 3/4, 3 = 5/6, 4 = 7/8, 5 = 9/10, 6 = 11/12 

```
